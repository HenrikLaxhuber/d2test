# d2test
A computer-based d2 test of attention with a backend written entirely in node.js.

The current version provides an extensive functionality and can be customized to fit any needs. However, the client UI is written in german - a translation should however be rather easy by editing the `dev/index.html` file as well as adapting the error messages in `dev/main.js`.

## Usage
For detailed instructions, consult the manual (englisj) in `doc/manual.pdf`. This manual aims to be as simple as possible and targets even the non computer-literate.
